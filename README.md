A production-style Loan Management System built using **Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Cloudinary, JWT Authentication, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.

The platform simulates the complete lifecycle of a loan — from borrower onboarding and document verification to sanction, disbursement, repayment collection, and loan closure.

# 🎯 Project Overview

Financial institutions process thousands of loan applications every day. Managing the complete lifecycle manually often results in slower approvals, limited visibility, and operational inefficiencies.
